## Overview
In this project, we'll be programming the Arduino Uno's built-in LED to blink on and off at 1-second intervals. This is a great starting point to learn how to write simple programs in the Arduino IDE, interact with hardware, and understand the flow of code on a microcontroller.

## Requirements
1. Arduino Uno
2. USB Cable to connect Arduino to your computer
3. Arduino IDE (download from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))

---

## Steps

### 1. Install Arduino IDE
- Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Launch the IDE after installation.

### 2. Connect Arduino to Computer
- Plug your Arduino Uno into your computer via the USB cable.
- Make sure your board is recognized by the IDE:
  - Go to **Tools** > **Board** and select **Arduino Uno**.
  - Then go to **Tools** > **Port** and select the correct COM port for your Arduino.

### 3. Write and Upload Code
- Create a new sketch in the Arduino IDE and paste the following code:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // Initialize the built-in LED pin as an output
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for one second
  
  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for one second
}
```

- Click the **Verify** button (âœ“) to check for errors.
- Click the **Upload** button (â†’) to upload the code to your Arduino Uno.

## Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

---

## Explanation
- The **`setup()`** function runs once when the Arduino is powered on or reset. It tells the board to set the built-in LED pin as an output.
- The **`loop()`** function runs over and over again forever. It turns the LED on and off, each time waiting for 1 second (`1000 milliseconds`) in between.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If the LED doesnâ€™t blink:
  - Ensure that you have the correct board and port selected under the **Tools** menu.
  - Double-check the USB connection.
  - Make sure the code is uploaded successfully with no errors.

Enjoy your first Arduino project! ðŸŽ‰

### Steps to Add Images
1. Capture screenshots of your Arduino Uno and the steps in the Arduino IDE (installation, code verification, uploading, etc.).
2. Save the images to a folder in your project directory.
3. Replace the `path_to_image/` placeholders in the README with the actual path to your images.

This will make your README visually appealing and more user-friendly!
